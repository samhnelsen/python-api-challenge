# python-api-challenge

In this challenge, I was asked to leverage the OpenWeatherMap API to explore weather trends using scatter plots and linear regressions along dimensions including latitude vs.:
 - Temperature
 - Humidity
 - Cloudiness
 - Wind Speed

Using the acquired weather data, I then leveraged the Geoapify API to map out locations with ideal vacation weather. Using these ideal vacation locations, I also mapped out hotels within a 10k meter radius of these locations.

All of my code and data outputs can be found in the Python API Challenge Code, Keys, and Output folder.
